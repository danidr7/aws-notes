# Simple Storage Service

A safe place to store files.

- Object based
	- key: the object name
	- value: the object content
	- version ID: the object version (when versioning)
	- metadata: some metadata about the object
	- sub-resources: ACL (Access Control Lists) and torrent
- files from 0 bytes to 5TB
- Bucket is like a namespace
- The Bucket must be an universal unique name
	- it'll create a web address like (https://danidr7.s3.amazonaws.com/)
- HTTP 200 code is the return when upload successfully
- New object are immediately available
- DELETE and PUT existent objects could happens an eventual consistency (can take some time to propagate)
- Control access to buckets with ACL or Polices

## Security & encription

- new buckets are private as default
	- it can be changed by ACL or Bucket Policies
- achieved by SSL/TLS

- Encryption ways:
	- SSE-S3 (Server Side Encryption, AWS manage the keys)
	- KMS (Key Managemente Service, AWS and user manage the keys)
	- SSE-C (Server Side Encryption With Customer, the user provide the keys to AWS)
	- Client Side Encryption (user upload the file already encrypted)

## Version Control

- must be enable in the bucket
- If enabled, it can not be disabled, only suspended
- stores all versions of an object (even if deleted)
- option for active MFA when delete

## Lifecycle rule

- allows to automate moving objects between tiers according to configurable rules
- can be used with versioning (for previous and current objects)

## S3 object lock

- store objects using a write once, read many (WORM) model
- prevent deletion and modifications for a fixed time or indefinitely
- can be individual objects or all the bucket

There are 2 modes:
- Governance Mode
	- users can't overwrite os delete an object
	- the permission can be changed for users
- Compliance Mode
	- version can't be overwritten or deleted by any user
	- retention mode can't be changed (retention is the time that the version will be protected, after that the object can be changed/deleted)

S3 Glacier Vault Lock
- 	Allows specify controls in a vault lock policy and lock the policy from future edits.

## S3 Performance

- low latency
- each prefix have a rate limit
	- prefix is the path between the bucket name and the object name
	- e.g: danidr7/folderA/folderB/file.jpg - prefix: folderA/folderB
- 3500 req/sec for PUT/COPY/POST/DELETE
- 5500 req/sec for GET/HEAD
- spread requests across the prefixes can achieve a better performance
- There is a limitation when using SSE-KMS
	- upload/download will count the quota
	- req/sec depends on region (5500, 10000 or 30000)
- Multipart uploads
	- it parallelizes the upload, increasing efficiency
	- recommended over 100MB
	- required over 5GB
- S3 Byte-Range Fetches
	- it parallelizes the download (speed up downloads)
	- split the content into parts
	- can be used for download partial file

## S3 Select

- allows retrieve a subset of data from an object by using simple SQL expressions
- get data by rows or columns
- save money on data transfer

## Sharing buckets

3 ways for share a bucket across accounts:
- through bucket policies & IAM (only programatic access)
- through bucket ACL & IAM (only programatic access)
- through IAM Roles (programatic and console access)

## Cross region replication

- enabled versioning are required in both bucket (source and destination)
- only replicates new objects (existent objects won't be replicated)
- deleted marker and deleted individual versions aren't replicated

## Transfer acceleration

- makes use of cloudfront edge nerwork
- upload first to a local edge location and then uploaded to bucket
- a distinct URL is provided (e.g: danidr7.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com)

## DataSync

- allows to move large files to AWS (e.g.: from a on-premise data center)
- there is a agent that copy/write data from AWS
- Used with NFS and SMB
- replicates EFS to EFS
- replication can be hourly, daily or weekly

## CloudFront

- Terminology:
	- `CDN`: content delivery network
	- `edge location`: where the content is cached
	- `origin`: the resource that is the origin of the files (S3, EC2, ELB or Route53)
	- `distribution`: CDN name. It is a collection of edge locations
- CloudFront is a CDN
- A way to cache large files in a location close to users
- When download a file, this will first download to a close edge location
- After the first download, the file will be available in the edge location according the TTL (time to live)
- edge locations aren't just read only, it is possible to write date there as well (put a object)
- the cached contents can be invalidated/clear, however it will be charged
- There are 2 types of distributions:
	- web distribution (used for websites)
	- RTMP (used for media streaming)

- Signed URLs and cookies
	- Used to secure content
	- Signed URL is used for individual files (1 file = 1 URL)
	- Signed cookie is used for multiple files (1 cokkie = multiple files)
	- A policy is attached to the signed URL/cookie
		- URL expiration
		- IP ranges
		- Trusted signers
	- CloudFront signed URL
		- Usually used when the origin is the EC2
	- S3 Signed URL
		- directly access to S3
		- single files

## Snowball

	- A big desk used to transport huge amount of data
	- Import/export from/to S3

## Storage Gateway
	- Connects an on-premise to AWS storage
	- Types:
		- File Gateway (NFS,SMB)
			- for flat files
			- saved as objects in S3
			- accessed via NFS
		- Volume Gateway (iSCSI block protocol)
			- stored volumes
				- all dataset is stored on site
				- backed up to S3 async
			- cached volumes
				- all dataset is stored on S3
				- frequently data is cached on site
		- Gateway Virtual Tape Library

## Athena
	- Interactive query service
	- Query data from S3 using SQL
	- Serveless

## Macie
	- Service for discover, classify and protect sensitive data in S3
	- Use AI for recognise PII (Personally Identifiable Information) in S3
	- Analyse Cloud Trail logs for suspicious API activity
	- Good for PCI-DSS
	- prevent ID (credit card) theft
