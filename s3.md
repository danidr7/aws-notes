# Simple Storage Service

A safe place to store files.

- Object based
	- key: the object name
	- value: the object content
	- version ID: the object version (when versioning)
	- metadata: some metadata about the object
	- sub-resources: ACL (Access Control Lists) and torrent
- files from 0 bytes to 5TB
- Bucket is like a namespace
- The Bucket must be an universal unique name
	- it'll create a web address like (https://danidr7.s3.amazonaws.com/)
- HTTP 200 code is the return when upload successfully
- New object are immediately available
- DELETE and PUT existent objects could happens an eventual consistency (can take some time to propagate)

	- 99.99% availability
	- 99.999999999% durability (11 nines)
	- more expensive
- S3 IA (Infrequently Accessed)
	- data less frequently accessed
	- rapid access
	- lower fee than s3, but the retrieval are charged
- S3 One Zone IA (similar to S3 RRS - reduce redundancy storage)
	- 99% availability
	- data less frequently accessed
	- lower cost
	- no multiple AZ
- s3 Intelligent Tearing
	- using machine learning to move objects around the different tiers
	- helps to save money
- s3 Glacier
	- for data archiving
	- configurable retrieval time (from minutes to hours)
- s3 Glacier Deep Archive
	- for data archiving
